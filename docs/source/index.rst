Welcome to XFSessionServer's documentation!
===========================================
**XFSessionServer** is a REST service that helps you handle users sessions and
store session information remotely with *minimal configuration*.

As you read this documentation, you'll get to see that we did all of this
in the easiest way possible for you. Almost everything in this library
can be done in just one line.

All of this was done with love for the dev community.
Be sure to check out the `repo <https://github.com/Masakuata/sessionServer>`_

.. note::

   This service is still not ready for public usage!

   It will be released as soon as possible.

To start check out the :ref:`installation <installation>` guide.
