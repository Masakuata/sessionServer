# XFSessionServer

**THIS SERVICE IS NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USAGE**

Wanna make an app or server without the hassle of handling user sessions among multiple clients?
Then hop right in

XFSessionServer is a service that handles user sessions and remote session storage for you.
If you're developing in python3, I got a library to make everything easier!

Python3 library documentation right [here](https://sessionserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you wanna get into alpha testing, DM me at @EdsonManuelVera.
