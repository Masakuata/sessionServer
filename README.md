**THIS SERVICE IS NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USAGE**

Want to make an app or server without the hassle of handling user sessions among multiple clients?
Then hop right in.

XFSessionServer is an HTTP service that handles user sessions and remote session storage for you.
If you're developing in python3, I got a library to make everything easier!

Python3 library [documentation](https://sessionserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Documentation to implement your own session service with our technology is still on the works.

If you want to get into alpha testing, DM me at @EdsonManuelVera.
